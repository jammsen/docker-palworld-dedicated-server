## Getting started

1. Create a `game` sub-directory on your Docker-Node in your game-server-directory (Example: `/srv/palworld`).
   - This directory will be used to store the game server files, including configs and savegames.
2. Set up Port-Forwarding or NAT for the ports in the Docker-Compose file.
3. Pull the latest version of the image with `docker pull jammsen/palworld-dedicated-server:latest`.
4. Download the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and [default.env](default.env).
5. Set up the `docker-compose.yml` and `default.env` to your liking.
   - Refer to the [Environment-Variables](#environment-variables) section for more information.
6. Start the container via `docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f`.
   - Watch the log, if no errors occur you can close the logs with ctrl+c.
7. Now have fun and happy gaming! ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜‰

## Environment variables

See [this file](/docs/ENV_VARS.md) for the documentation

## Docker-Compose examples

### Gameserver with RCON-CLI-Tool

See [example docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

## Run RCON commands

Open a shell into your container via `docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server bash`, then you can run commands against the gameserver via the command `rconcli`

```shell
$:~/steamcmd$ rconcli showplayers
name,playeruid,steamid
$:~/steamcmd$ rconcli info
Welcome to Pal Server[v0.1.3.0] jammsen-docker-generated-20384
$:~/steamcmd$ rconcli save
Complete Save
```

You can also use `docker exec palworld-dedicated-server rconcli <command>` right on your terminal/shell.

```shell
$ docker exec palworld-dedicated-server rconcli showplayers
name,playeruid,steamid

$ docker exec palworld-dedicated-server rconcli info
Welcome to Pal Server[v0.1.3.0] jammsen-docker-generated-20384

$ docker exec palworld-dedicated-server rconcli save
Complete Save
```

> **Important:** Please research the RCON-Commands on the official source: https://tech.palworldgame.com/server-commands

## Backup Manager

> [!WARNING]
> If RCON is disabled, the backup manager won't do saves via RCON before creating a backup.
> This means that the backup will be created from the last auto-save of the server.
> This can lead to data-loss and/or savegame corruption.
>
> **Recommendation:** Please make sure that RCON is enabled before using the backup manager.

Usage: `docker exec palworld-dedicated-server backup [command] [arguments]`

Examples:

```shell
$ docker exec palworld-dedicated-server backup
>> Backup 'saved-20240203_032855.tar.gz' created successfully.
```

```shell
$ docker exec palworld-dedicated-server backup list
>> Listing 2 backup file(s)!
2024-02-03 03:28:55 | saved-20240203_032855.tar.gz
2024-02-03 03:28:00 | saved-20240203_032800.tar.gz
```

```shell
$ docker exec palworld-dedicated-server backup_clean 3
>> 1 backup(s) cleaned, keeping 2 backups(s).
```

```shell
$ docker exec palworld-dedicated-server backup_list   
>> Listing 1 out of backup 2 file(s).
2024-02-03 03:30:00 | saved-20240203_033000.tar.gz
```

## Webhook integration

To enable webhook integration, you need to set the following environment variables in the `default.env`:

```shell
WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true
WEBHOOK_URL="https://your.webhook.url"
```

After that the server should send messages in a Discord-Compatible way to your webhook.

> You can find more details about these variables [here](/docs/ENV_VARS.md#webhook-settings).

### Supported events

## Deploy with Helm

A Helm chart to deploy this container can be found at [palworld-helm](https://github.com/caleb-devops/palworld-helm).

## FAQ

### How can I use the interactive console in Portainer with this image?

> You can run this `docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server bash' or you could navigate to the **"Stacks"** tab in Portainer, select your stack, and click on the container name. Then click on the **"Exec console"** button.

### How can I look into the config of my Palworld container?

> You can run this `docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server cat /palworld/Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini` and it will show you the config inside the container.

### I'm seeing S_API errors in my logs when I start the container?

> Errors like `[S_API FAIL] Tried to access Steam interface SteamUser021 before SteamAPI_Init succeeded.` are safe to ignore.

### I'm using Apple silicon type of hardware, can I run this?

> You can try to insert in your docker-compose file this parameter `platform: linux/amd64` at the palworld service. This isn't a special fix for Apple silicon, but to run on other than x86 hosts. The support for arm exists only by enforcing x86 emulation, if that isn't to host already. Rosetta is doing the translation/emulation.

### I changed the `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` setting, why didn't this update the server?

> This is a confirmed bug. Changing `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` in the `PalWorldSettings.ini` has no effect on the server. There are tools out there to help with this, like this one: <https://github.com/legoduded/palworld-worldoptions>

> [!WARNING]
> Adding `WorldOption.sav` will break `PalWorldSetting.ini`. So any new changes to the settings (either on the file or via ENV VARS), you will have to create a new `WorldOption.sav` and update it everytime for those changes to have effect.
