## What you need to run this

- Basic understanding of Docker, Docker-Compose, Linux and Networking (Port-Forwarding/NAT)

## Getting started

1. Choose a Docker-Compose examples from below
2. Create `game` sub-directories on your Dockernode in your game-server-directory (Example: `/srv/palworld`) and give it with `chmod 777 game` full permissions or use `chown -R 1000:1000 game/`.
3. Setup Port-Forwarding or NAT for the ports in the Docker-Compose file
4. (Build the image if you need) Start via `docker-compose up -d` - See docker-compose.yml and next section for more infos
5. After first start, stop the server, setup your config at `game/Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini` and start it again

    entrypoint: ['/rcon', '-a', '10.0.0.5:25575', '-p', 'adminPasswordHere']
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    depends_on:
      - palworld-dedicated-server
```
The profiles defintion, prevents the container from starting with the server and in your console you can run now RCON commands via
#### RCON
In your shell you can now run commands against the gameserver via RCON
```shell
$ docker compose run --rm rcon ShowPlayers
name,playeruid,steamid
$ docker compose run --rm rcon info
Welcome to Pal Server[v0.1.2.0] jammsen-docker-generated-20384
$ docker compose run --rm rcon save
Complete Save
```
**Imporant:**
- Keep the `--rm` in the command line, or you will have many exited containers in your list. 
- All RCON-Commands can be research here: https://tech.palworldgame.com/server-commands

## FAQ

### How can i look into the config of my Palworld container?
You can run this `docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server cat /palworld/Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini` and it will show you the config inside the container.

### Im seeing S_API errors in my logs when i start the container
Errors like `[S_API FAIL] Tried to access Steam interface SteamUser021 before SteamAPI_Init succeeded.` are safe to ignore.
