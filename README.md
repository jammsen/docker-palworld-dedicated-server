## Requirements

To run this Docker image, you need a basic understanding of Docker, Docker-Compose, Linux, and Networking (Port-Forwarding/NAT).

## Minimum system requirements

| Resource | 1-8 players                   | 8-12+ players                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| CPU      | 4 CPU-Cores @ High GHz        | 6-8 CPU Cores @ High GHz       |
| RAM      | 8GB RAM Base + 2GB per player | 12GB RAM Base + 2GB per player |
| Storage  | 30GB                          | 30GB+                          |

## Getting started

1. Create a `game` sub-directory on your Docker-Node in your game-server-directory (Example: `/srv/palworld`). 
   * This directory will be used to store the game-data and configuration persistently (on restart, on stop, on kill, ... ).
    ````shell
    mkdir -p /srv/palworld/game
    ````
2. Set up Port-Forwarding or NAT for the ports in the Docker-Compose file.
3. Pull the latest version of the image with:
    ```shell	
    docker pull jammsen/palworld-dedicated-server:latest
    ```
4. Download the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and [default.env](default.env).
5. Set up the `docker-compose.yml` and `default.env` to your liking.
   * Refer to the [Environment-Variables](#environment-variables) section for more information.
6. Start the container with:
    ```shell	
    docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
    ```
   * Watch the log. If no errors occur, you can close the logs with `ctrl+c`.
7. Now have fun and happy gaming! 🎮😉

Examples:
```shell
$ docker exec <container_name_or_id> backup
>>> Creating backup...

>>> Backup created successfully!
```
```shell
$ docker exec <container_name_or_id> backup_list 5
>>> Listing backups:

> Found 3 backup file(s)!
```

> [!WARNING]
> When RCON is disabled, the backup manager won't do saves before creating a backup.
> This means that the backup will be created from the last save.
> This can lead to data loss or corruption.
>
> **Please make sure that RCON is enabled before using the backup manager!**
> 
> Otherwise use it at your own risk! 🥲

## Run RCON commands

Open a shell into your container via `docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server bash`, then you can run commands against the gameserver via the command `rcon` or `rconcli`

```shell
$:~/steamcmd$ rcon showplayers
name,playeruid,steamid
$:~/steamcmd$ rcon info
Welcome to Pal Server[v0.1.3.0] jammsen-docker-generated-20384
$:~/steamcmd$ rcon save
Complete Save
```
------ OR ------

Do a `docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server -c "rconcli <command>"` right on your terminal/shell.
```shell
$ docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server -c "rconcli showplayers"
name,playeruid,steamid

$ docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server -c "rconcli info"
Welcome to Pal Server[v0.1.3.0] jammsen-docker-generated-20384

$ docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server -c "rconcli save"
Complete Save
```
> **Important:** Please research the RCON-Commands on the official source: https://tech.palworldgame.com/server-commands

## Webhook integration

To enable webhook integration, you need to set the following environment variables in the `default.env`:

```shell
WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true
WEBHOOK_URL="https://your.webhook.url"
```
After that the server should send messages in a Discord-Compatible way to your webhook.

### Supported events
* Server starting
* Server stopped

## Deploy with Helm

A Helm chart to deploy this container can be found at [palworld-helm](https://github.com/caleb-devops/palworld-helm).

## FAQ

### How can I use the interactive console in Portainer with this image?

You can run this `docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server bash' or you could navigate to the **"Stacks"** tab in Portainer, select your stack, and click on the container name. Then click on the **"Exec console"** button.

### How can I look into the config of my Palworld container?

You can run this `docker exec -ti palworld-dedicated-server cat /palworld/Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini` and it will show you the config inside the container.

### I'm seeing S_API errors in my logs when I start the container?

Errors like `[S_API FAIL] Tried to access Steam interface SteamUser021 before SteamAPI_Init succeeded.` are safe to ignore.

### I'm using Apple silicon type of hardware, can I run this?

You can try to insert in your docker-compose file this parameter `platform: linux/amd64` at the palworld service. This isnt a special fix for Apple silicon, but to run on other than x86 hosts. The support for arm exists only by enforcing x86 emulation, if that isnt to host already. Rosetta is doing the translation/emulation.

### I changed the `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` setting, why didn't this update the server?

This is a confirmed bug. Changing `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` in the `PalWorldSettings.ini` has no affect on the server. There are tools out there to help with this, like this one: <https://github.com/legoduded/palworld-worldoptions>

**PLEASE NOTE** Adding `WorldOption.sav` will break `PalWorldSetting.ini`. To make changes, you must update your `WorldOption.sav` again.
