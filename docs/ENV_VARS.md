# Environment Variables

[Back to main](../README.md#environment-variables)

In this section you will find a lot of environment variables to control your container-behavior and gameserver-settings. Due to the extensive control options, the settings are split into two parts for documentation: **Container-Settings** and **Gameserver-Settings**.

## Container-Settings

These settings control the behavior of the Docker container:

> **Important:** If you want to change the server settings via environment variables use the default value (`auto`) for the environment variable `SERVER_SETTINGS_MODE`, otherwise change it to `manual` and edit the config file directly.

### SERVER_SETTINGS_MODE explained

SERVER_SETTINGS_MODE accepts 2 values:
- `auto`: Settings are modified only by environment variables, manual edits will be ignored
- `rcononly`: RCON-Settings are modified by environment variables (RCON_ENABLED, RCON_PORT, ADMIN_PASSWORD), everything else has to be done by editing the file directly, other environment variables are ignored
- `manual`: Settings are modified only by editing the file directly, environment variables are ignored


### Webhook environment variables

> [!WARNING]
> **IMPORTANT: Don't use Hex-Colors!**
>
> Go to the page, search for the Hex-Color, after that add the DECIMAL-Representation to the color field or it will break for Discord!
> >https://www.spycolor.com/

There are a lot of Variables to setup for messages and colors to send to the webhook url in the `default.env`

### TZ identifiers

The `TZ` setting affects logging output and the backup function. [TZ identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#Time_Zone_abbreviations) are a format for defining a timezone near you.

### Cron expression

The `BACKUP_CRON_EXPRESSION` setting affects the backup function. In a Cron-Expression, you define an interval for when to run jobs. This image uses Supercronic for crons, see https://github.com/aptible/supercronic#crontab-format or https://crontab-generator.org

## Gameserver-Settings

This section lists all the settings currently adjustable via Docker environment variables, based on the **order** and **contents of the DefaultPalWorldSettings.ini**.

Information sources and credits to the following websites:

- [Palworld Tech Guide](https://tech.palworldgame.com/settings-and-operation/configuration) for the game server documentation
- [PalworldSettingGenerator](https://dysoncheng.github.io/PalWorldSettingGenerator/setting.html) for variable descriptions

> **Important:** Please note that all of this is subject to change. **The game is still in early access.**
>
> To change a setting, you can set the environment variable to the value you want. If the environment variable is not set or is blank, the default value will be used.
